# stk500v2-bootloader

This project is forked from Peter Fleury's [stk500v2bootloader](http://homepage.hispeed.ch/peterfleury/avr-software.html).
The project implements a *STK500v2 compatible bootloader* for Atmel AVR microcontrolers.

## Why doing a fork?

The original code is not hosted an a platform allowing collaborative work. Since I need some special
features, I decided to place a fork at github to add my features. The original source is placed in the
branch `vendor`. All my changes are done in the branch `develop` and than released into the branch
`master`.

Since the original code has no version number, I use a version number for my changes. This version
starts at 1.0.
